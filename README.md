# ToolboxModels
A collection of (almost) all 52 2004-05 Roblox models from Block 2x4x1 to Red figure.  This collection was originally made by Client Search and the original file is still publicly available on their Discord server.  Except Ball 4x4x4 (which is possibly corrupted), all models have their original .xml code extracted from multiple places, mainly from 2006-2009.  It can also be obtained today by typing the ID at the end of this link: https://assetdelivery.roblox.com/v1/asset?id=.  All models were removed after the data wipe of Spring 2005, re-upload dates span from from May 10, 2005 to May 13, 2005.
If you are wondering why the colors look different on the actual model pages, it is because they used RGB color codes and the colors became corrupted on January 10th, 2006.  The models became fully corrupted around 2013 because of the new font change, and became unavailable afterwards on the Roblox website.

If you insert them into a modern Roblox Studio version, they will become corrupted, you will have to insert the model into an older version of Roblox Studio, preferably the 2007-2008 versions, then export the model into the modern version.
